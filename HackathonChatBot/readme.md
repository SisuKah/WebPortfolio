At the Junction Hackathon, we built a privacy-aware ChatBot in just 48 hours. The system was designed to process patient data while enforcing strict filtering rules to ensure compliance and data protection.
Our project used, python apis to communicate with the frontend which was built with nextjs, typescript and used Firestore database both for database and authentication. We ended up 3rd place and won 200e.
