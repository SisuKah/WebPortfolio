# ðŸ§° Minecraft Armor Durability Application

I built Python scripts to automate a Minecraft resource pack, generating **4000+ textures** and `.properties` files. Using **Python** and **Pillow**, the scripts applied gradient overlays, added durability numbers, and structured files automatically â€” turning a tedious manual task into a smooth pipeline.  



The project unexpectedly reached **1500+ players** downloads. Even though it received harsh feedback in the community, it taught me to see the real value of what I create, handle criticism constructively, and stay focused on providing value to other people.
