# Qr-Memo Website

I built a modern website for **Qr-Memo**, a company offering QR code–based digital memorials. The site highlights the service with a clean, responsive design, focusing on clarity, trust, and accessibility.

The project was developed using **Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and Vercel** — ensuring fast performance, secure backend integration, and professional deployment.
